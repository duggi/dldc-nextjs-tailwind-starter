## Quick start
1. Next.js requires Node.js version 18.17.0 or later
2. Download latest release as a `.zip` file
3. Unzip and run `npm install`
4. Then, run `npm run dev`
5. In a browser, visit `localhost:3000` [(see screenshot)](https://github.com/duggi/dldc-nextjs-tailwind-starter/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#screenshot-of-the-home-page-at-localhost3000)
6. Modify files in `src/app`, `styles/`, and `components/` directories

## What is this?
This is an all open source, easy to use, simple-as-possible Next.js and Tailwind CSS starter app. It creates a home page with a hero and grid component at `localhost:3000`

The build is kept as simple as possible and uses only npm, Typescript, and PostCSS. Does not have any database or service dependencies.

## Who is this for?
For designers and anyone else who wants to start a React page or idea, and doesn't want to make a lot of decisions or wind up tangled in a complicated, hard-to-use environment.

Download the zip file, install dependencies, `npm run dev` and you can start creating pages and components right away at localhost:3000. Minimally configured for maximum flexibility.

## What do I need?
- You are familiar with a terminal environment, for deployment you must know Git
- You have or can install recent versions of Node and npm
- You know at least a minimal amount of Javascript

## Platform, stack, and tooling
Publishing and deployment platform is Vercel, the creators of Next.js. 

Tailwind does a lot of heavy lifting:
- CSS from Tailwind CSS
- Icons from Heroicons library (by Tailwind team)
- Form library and utilities from Headless UI (by Tailwind team)

**Technical notes**
- Typescript in strict mode selected for deployment compatibility, although it makes React more technical to use
- Tailwind CSS in installed into Next.js using PostCSS — the Vercel recommended tool
